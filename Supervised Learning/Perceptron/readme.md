Model Description
A perceptron operates by taking binary inputs, applying weighted sums, and passing the result through an activation function to produce an output. The architecture consists of input nodes, weights assigned to inputs, a summation function, and an activation function. This model learns by adjusting weights based on errors during training, utilizing a learning algorithm like the perceptron learning rule.

Notebook Structure
1. Essential Imports
The notebook begins with importing necessary libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data handling, visualization, and model evaluation.

2. Building the Perceptron Class
The notebook defines a Perceptron class responsible for modeling binary classification. Key methods include initialization, activation function, loss calculation, gradient approximation, weight updating through gradient descent, fitting the model, and prediction.

3. Preprocessing
The dataset (IBM Employee Attrition) undergoes essential preprocessing steps:

Removal of variables with zero variance.
Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
Standardizing features to ensure uniform scales.
4. Model Training and Evaluation
The perceptron model is trained using the preprocessed dataset. Key steps include:

Data splitting into training and test sets.
Instantiating and fitting the perceptron model using training data.
Evaluating model performance through accuracy metrics, loss history, and confusion matrix visualization.
5. Performance Analysis
The notebook concludes with an analysis of the model's performance, displaying training and test accuracy scores, a scatter plot with decision boundary, confusion matrix, and a classification report.

Conclusion
The perceptron, while effective for linearly separable data, might experience reduced accuracy with complex, non-linear datasets like the IBMEmployeeAttrition dataset. However, its simplicity and computational efficiency make it suitable for simpler classification tasks with linearly separable data patterns.
