Linear Regression Implementation
Introduction
The "Linear Regression.ipynb" notebook showcases the implementation of Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, using Python and various libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. This notebook details the process of examining a real estate dataset from New Taipei City, Taiwan, focusing on data inspection, visualization, data regularization, model implementation, training, evaluation, and error analysis.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains real estate valuations from New Taipei City. The exploration begins by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame to understand its structure, attributes, and contents, facilitating further analysis and planning for model building.

Notebook Structure
1. Importing Libraries and Data
The notebook starts by importing essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. The dataset, "Real estate.csv," is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Data Regularization
Data regularization is crucial to ensure feature scaling consistency for model stability and effectiveness. This phase includes z-score normalization to standardize features, preventing bias due to varying magnitudes across features.

3. Data Splitting
Dividing the dataset into training and test sets is essential for model training and validation. Here, 2/3 of the data is allocated for training, and 1/3 for testing.

4. Model Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using two methods: gradient descent and the normal equation. Both methods compute optimal weights iteratively or analytically, respectively, to minimize the mean squared error. The notebook visualizes the training process, evaluates the model on test data, and compares both methods' performance.

5. Results Visualization
Visualizations showcase feature versus price/sqft comparisons, aiding in understanding relationships between features and predicted versus actual values.

6. Error Analysis
The notebook concludes by evaluating the model's efficacy through various error metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and $R^2$ Error. These metrics quantify the model's performance and its predictive accuracy on the test data.

Conclusion
The Linear Regression implementation within this notebook demonstrates the foundational concepts of regression modeling, data regularization, model training, evaluation, and error analysis. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, model training techniques, and error evaluation in understanding and assessing regression models' predictive capabilities.
