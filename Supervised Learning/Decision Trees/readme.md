Decision Trees
This notebook explores the application and insights derived from Decision Trees in both classification and regression tasks. Decision Trees are interpretable models that partition datasets into smaller subsets, creating a tree-like structure to make predictions based on various features.

Key Concepts
Algorithm: Decision Trees split data based on features to maximize information gain, resulting in nodes representing distinct features and leaf nodes indicating final decisions or outputs.
Advantages: Known for interpretability, handling both numerical and categorical data, and requiring minimal data preprocessing. Additionally, they can capture non-linear patterns effectively.
Disadvantages: Prone to overfitting with deeper trees, sensitive to small data variations, and may not suit linear relationships.
Dataset Analysis
The notebook utilizes a diabetes dataset, focusing on 'Glucose' and 'BloodPressure' to determine diabetes presence. Visualizations showcase the data distribution, highlighting the absence (blue) or presence (red) of diabetes.

Dataset
his dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

Model Building and Analysis
Training and Testing: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with decision tree models fitted on the training data.
Visualizations: The decision tree models' visual representations help understand the model's decision-making process based on 'Glucose' and 'BloodPressure.'
Evaluation Metrics: Confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-scores offer insights into model performance.
Impact of Tree Depth: Analyzes how altering the decision tree's depth affects predictive performance.
Conclusion
The analysis suggests that changing the tree's depth within a certain range minimally affects predictive performance. Precision scores remain stable, implying consistent classification accuracy across varying tree depths.
