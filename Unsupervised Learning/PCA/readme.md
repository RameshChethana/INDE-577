PCA Implementation
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is showcased in this notebook as a powerful technique for condensing high-dimensional datasets into a more manageable form while preserving essential information. The primary objective of PCA is to reduce dimensionality while retaining as much variance as possible. By identifying and capturing the most influential aspects of the data, PCA reorients it along its principal components, which are orthogonal directions capturing maximum variance.

Overview
The notebook covers the following aspects:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Demonstrates the use of PCA on the "Real estate" dataset by standardizing features and reducing dimensions to visualize the components.

Dataset

Concerns housing values in suburbs of Boston.

Number of Instances: 506

Number of Attributes: 13 continuous attributes (including "class"
attribute "MEDV"), 1 binary-valued attribute.

Attribute Information:

CRIM per capita crime rate by town
ZN proportion of residential land zoned for lots over
25,000 sq.ft.
INDUS proportion of non-retail business acres per town
CHAS Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds
river; 0 otherwise)
NOX nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
RAD index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO pupil-teacher ratio by town
B 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks
by town
LSTAT % lower status of the population
MEDV Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
Missing Attribute Values: None.

Model Evaluation: Utilizes several regression models (KNeighborsRegressor, Linear Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor, and SVR) to evaluate their performance on the reduced-dimensional dataset obtained through PCA.

Key Insights
PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: Displays the impact of reducing dimensions on model performance and visualizes data using scatter plots post-PCA transformation.
Model Evaluation: Compares Mean Squared Error (MSE) for different models on the original and reduced-dimensional data to assess the impact of PCA.
Observations
PCA's Impact on Models: The notebook evaluates various regression models on the reduced-dimensional dataset and compares their performance metrics (MSE) with those on the original dataset. This allows observing the models' effectiveness in predicting the target variable after PCA transformation.

Visualization: Scatter plots illustrate model predictions on the reduced-dimensional data, aiding in the assessment of how PCA affects model predictions.
